Sure, hereâ€™s a fun math problem for you:

**Problem:**

You have a rectangular garden that measures 20 meters in length and 15 meters in width. You want to create a walkway of uniform width around the garden. The area of the walkway should be equal to the area of the garden.

**Question:**

What should be the width of the walkway?

**Solution:**

1. Let the width of the walkway be \( x \) meters.
2. The dimensions of the garden with the walkway will be \( (20 + 2x) \) meters by \( (15 + 2x) \) meters.
3. The area of the garden is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) square meters.
4. The area of the garden with the walkway is \( (20 + 2x) \times (15 + 2x) \) square meters.
5. The area of the walkway alone is the area of the garden with the walkway minus the area of the garden:

\[ (20 + 2x)(15 + 2x) - 300 \]

6. We want the area of the walkway to be equal to the area of the garden, so:

\[ (20 + 2x)(15 + 2x) - 300 = 300 \]

7. Simplify and solve for \( x \):

\[ (20 + 2x)(15 + 2x) = 600 \]
\[ 300 + 30x + 40x + 4x^2 = 600 \]
\[ 4x^2 + 70x + 300 = 600 \]
\[ 4x^2 + 70x - 300 = 0 \]

8. Solve the quadratic equation:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
\[ a = 4, \; b = 70, \; c = -300 \]
\[ x = \frac{-70 \pm \sqrt{70^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-300)}}{2 \cdot 4} \]
\[ x = \frac{-70 \pm \sqrt{4900 + 4800}}{8} \]
\[ x = \frac{-70 \pm \sqrt{9700}}{8} \]
\[ x = \frac{-70 \pm 98.49}{8} \]

9. The two possible solutions are:

\[ x = \frac{28.49}{8} = 3.56 \]
\[ x = \frac{-168.49}{8} = -21.06 \] (This is not a valid solution because the width cannot be negative)

So, the width of the walkway should be approximately **3.56 meters**.
