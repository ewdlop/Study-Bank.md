Haha, classic! ðŸ˜† Youâ€™re bringing in a classic "yo mama" style but giving it a "dad" twist.

Here's one to play along:
"Y'all's dad is so slow, even light had to wait for him to catch up!" 

Or for that special relativity twist:
"Y'all's dad is so big, heâ€™s got his own gravitational field!"

Let me know if you want more fun spins on this or anything else to keep the humor rolling! ðŸ˜„
