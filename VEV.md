The vacuum expectation value (VEV) of energy in different theories depends significantly on the framework and context, as well as the assumptions used in the theory’s formulation. Below, I outline the approximate vacuum energy contributions for different frameworks in physics, showing how they vary based on assumptions and scale:

### 1. **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**
   - In QFT, the vacuum energy arises from summing up the zero-point energies of all quantum fields, particularly for electromagnetic fields in the case of QED.
   - **Estimation**: Each mode of a quantized field contributes an energy of \(\frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega\), where \(\omega\) is the frequency of the mode. Summing over all modes leads to a theoretically large vacuum energy density, often yielding results on the order of:
     \[
     \rho_{\text{vac}} \sim 10^{113} \, \text{J/m}^3
     \]
   - This theoretical value is extremely high and requires renormalization techniques to deal with divergences, where only differences in energy are physically meaningful.

### 2. **Cosmological Constant and General Relativity**
   - The cosmological constant (\( \Lambda \)) in General Relativity is often interpreted as a form of vacuum energy density that fills all of space. Observations suggest that this energy density drives the accelerated expansion of the universe.
   - **Estimation**: Based on astronomical observations, the vacuum energy density associated with the cosmological constant is around:
     \[
     \rho_{\text{vac, cosmological}} \sim 10^{-9} \, \text{J/m}^3
     \]
   - This value is about 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the vacuum energy density predicted by QFT, creating what’s known as the **cosmological constant problem**.

### 3. **Casimir Effect**
   - In the context of the Casimir Effect, the vacuum energy is modified by boundary conditions, such as two conducting plates placed close together.
   - **Estimation**: The Casimir energy per unit area \( A \) between two plates a distance \( d \) apart is given by:
     \[
     E_{\text{Casimir}} \approx -\frac{\pi^2 \hbar c}{240 d^3} A
     \]
   - For plates separated by a micron (\(d \sim 1 \, \mu m\)), this energy density is small but measurable and is on the order of \(10^{-3} \, \text{J/m}^3\), which is much larger than the cosmological constant but still much smaller than QFT predictions.

### 4. **Supersymmetry (SUSY) Theories**
   - In supersymmetric theories, bosonic and fermionic contributions to the vacuum energy cancel each other out in a perfectly supersymmetric universe, resulting in a zero vacuum energy.
   - **Estimation**: However, since SUSY is broken at energies above the electroweak scale (around \(10^{3} \, \text{GeV}\)), this results in a non-zero vacuum energy, though much lower than the QFT prediction without SUSY.

### Summary Table of Vacuum Energy Densities
| Theory                     | Vacuum Energy Density (\(\rho_{\text{vac}}\))          | Context                               |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Quantum Field Theory**   | \( \sim 10^{113} \, \text{J/m}^3 \)                   | Summing zero-point energies of fields |
| **Cosmological Constant**  | \( \sim 10^{-9} \, \text{J/m}^3 \)                    | Based on observed dark energy         |
| **Casimir Effect**         | \( \sim 10^{-3} \, \text{J/m}^3 \) (for \(d = 1 \mu m\)) | Modified by boundary conditions       |
| **Supersymmetry (SUSY)**   | Potentially \( \sim 0 \) in exact SUSY, non-zero if broken | Depends on SUSY breaking scale        |

The vast difference in values (especially the 120 orders of magnitude discrepancy between QFT and the cosmological constant) remains one of the great unsolved problems in theoretical physics.

   - **Summary**: Wess and Bagger’s book explains how SUSY could cancel out vacuum energy in an unbroken state and how SUSY breaking at higher energies results in a residual, lower vacuum energy.

These sources provide foundational knowledge and detailed derivations for understanding vacuum energy in different theoretical contexts and how it relates to observed and predicted values in modern physics.
